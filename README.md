# Android Static Analysis Framework

## Overview
This project is a static analysis framework designed to analyze Android APK files for common security vulnerabilities. It helps identify insecure permissions, hardcoded secrets, insecure API usage, and other potential risks without executing the application.

## Features
- Parses `AndroidManifest.xml` and source files to detect risky permissions and exported components.
- Detects hardcoded credentials and secrets in the APK.
- Identifies insecure cryptographic practices and SSL/TLS misconfigurations.
- Generates detailed security reports highlighting findings mapped to CVSS scores.
- Helps developers and security analysts improve Android app security posture.

## Technologies Used
- Kotlin / Java
- APKTool (for APK decompilation)
- Custom rule engine for vulnerability detection
- OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) compliance mapping
